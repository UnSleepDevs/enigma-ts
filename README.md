# Little-Enigma (Typescript Version)

This version aims to be finished in less than a week, to do this I've migrated from C++ -> Typescript (Using Bun runtime)

## Development

### Requirements

* [Bun](https://bun.sh) **>=v 1.31** - You need it for run/compile your project.

### Running

* To install dependencies:

  ```bash
  bun install
  ```

* To debug (run without compile):

  ```bash
  bun debug # Load without compile
  bun reload # Hot reloading, instant changes apply
  ```

* To compile:
  * For *NIX systems:

    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

  * For Windows systems:

    ```bash
    bun run build-win
    ```
